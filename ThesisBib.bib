abstract = {One of the pathways by which the scientific community confirms the validity of a new scientific discovery is by repeating the research that produced it. When a scientific effort fails to independently confirm the computations or results of a previous study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency can be an important precursor to new discovery. Concerns about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research. Reproducibility and Replicability in Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and non-replicability in research. While reproducibility is straightforward and should generally be expected, the report says, replicability is more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This report provides recommendations to researchers, academic institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to improve reproducibility and replicability in science.},

abstract = {This study has considered anchoveta acoustic data from the Pelagic Resources Hydroacoustic Assessment Surveys carried out by the Peruvian Sea Institute (IMARPE) and free access satellite data (HYCOM and MODIS from the USA) of some oceanographic variables between the period 2011 and 2021, to know the oceanographic conditions, characteristics of schools and size structure in the optimum zone (OZ) and in the physiological stress zone (PSZ), of their total distribution. The OZ is determined by the extent of the Cold Coastal Waters (CCW), and the PSZ is determined by the mixing of waters, to the north by the CCW-ESW (Equatorial Surface Waters) and to the west between the CCW-SSW (Subtropical Surface Waters). The range of sea surface temperature and salinity in the PSZ (16.1–25.0°C and 34.65–35.29, respectively) was wider than in the OZ (14.5–24.0°C and 34.65–35.20, respectively), where a higher number of schools were recorded. Our analyses showed that the morphometric and energetic acoustic descriptors of anchoveta schools in the summer were higher during summers compared to springs. In terms of positional characteristics, the mean depth of the schools in the PSZ was slightly greater than in the OZ. The total size structure of anchoveta in the OZ consisted mainly of juvenile specimens (less than 12 cm total length) in the summer of 2011 and 2013–2014 and in the spring between 2014–2017 and 2021. In the PSZ, adult specimens (greater than 12 cm total length) predominated in summer between 2011–2013, 2015, 2018, and 2021 and in spring between 2011–2013, 2015, and between 2018–2021. However, specimens greater than 10 cm in total length were found in the PSZ. Knowledge of the location of this zone away from the coast will allow a high probability of anchoveta capture of adult specimens during fishing periods.},

abstract = {We take advantage of the longest high quality single-sensor global data set of ocean color available today to explore recent trends in the primary productivity of the main eastern boundary upwelling systems (EBUEs): California, Canary, Humboldt and Benguela. The chlorophyll-a concentration is used as a proxy for primary production. SST data from AVHRR and wind speed data from QuikSCAT are used in conjunction with this data set to analyse forcing mechanisms explaining the chlorophyll biomass. Whereas the worldwide primary-production biomass shows on average decreasing trends, as already observed in the stratified part of the worldwide ocean, the productivity of most EBUEs increases during the study period. These contrasting trends are both significant, at least for the mid latitude range of 50°S-50°N, where the data coverage is sufficient for accurate estimation. Probably due to the large scale atmospheric forcing, trends in sea surface temperature (SST) show non-significant relationships with the trends in biomass within upwelling systems, suggesting that SST anomalies cannot be used as an indicator of change in upwelling intensity in a continuous warming context. On the other hand, upwelling favourable equatorward winds show a significant correlation with the observed trends in biomass, suggesting that the trends in the trade winds are probably linked to an increase in the intensity of the Hadley cell circulation observed during the last several decades. {\textcopyright} 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

@article{Houde1989,
abstract = {Instantaneous daily growth and mortality rates each increased c0.01 per °C increase in temperature, but there was no significant regression of gross growth efficiency on temperature (mean K1=0.29), indicating no latitudinal relationship. The large increases in growth rate at high temperatures must be supported by increased food consumption, not increased growth efficiency. Oxygen uptakes also increased significantly in relation to temperature, but relatively slowly compared to growth rates. Larval stage duration was inversely related to growth rate. Potential variability in growth rate increased with temperature; the opposite trend was observed for stage duration, which tended to be both long and potentially variable in high latitudes. Early life, density-dependent regulation is thus more probable in high than in low latitudes. The required ingestion to support average growth rate increased 3-fold in the 10-30°C range, indicating that fish larvae in warm seas may be more likely to starve than larvae in cold seas. Spawning in low latitudes often is protracted with frequent batches in contrast to spawning in high latitudes, where seasons are brief with one or a few batches. -from Author},

abstract = {Primary production by marine phytoplankton is one of the largest fluxes of carbon on our planet. In the past few decades, considerable progress has been made in estimating global primary production at high spatial and temporal scales by combining in situ measurements of primary production with remote-sensing observations of phytoplankton biomass. One of the major challenges in this approach lies in the assignment of the appropriate model parameters that define the photosynthetic response of phytoplankton to the light field. In the present study, a global database of in situ measurements of photosynthesis versus irradiance (P-I) parameters and a 20-year record of climate quality satellite observations were used to assess global primary production and its variability with seasons and locations as well as between years. In addition, the sensitivity of the computed primary production to potential changes in the photosynthetic response of phytoplankton cells under changing environmental conditions was investigated. Global annual primary production varied from 38.8 to 42.1 Gt C yr − 1 over the period of 1998–2018. Inter-annual changes in global primary production did not follow a linear trend, and regional differences in the magnitude and direction of change in primary production were observed. Trends in primary production followed directly from changes in chlorophyll-a and were related to changes in the physico-chemical conditions of the water column due to inter-annual and multidecadal climate oscillations. Moreover, the sensitivity analysis in which P-I parameters were adjusted by ±1 standard deviation showed the importance of accurately assigning photosynthetic parameters in global and regional calculations of primary production. The assimilation number of the P-I curve showed strong relationships with environmental variables such as temperature and had a practically one-to-one relationship with the magnitude of change in primary production. In the future, such empirical relationships could potentially be used for a more dynamic assignment of photosynthetic rates in the estimation of global primary production. Relationships between the initial slope of the P-I curve and environmental variables were more elusive.},

abstract = {Climate may act on the dispersal and connectivity of marine populations through changes in the oceanic circulation and temperature, and by modifying species' prey and predator distributions. As dispersal and connectivity remain difficult to assess in situ, a first step in studying the effects of climate change can be achieved using biophysical models. To date, only a few biophysical models have been used for this purpose. Here we review these studies and also include results from other recent modelling efforts. We show that increased sea temperature, a major change expected under climate warming, may impact dispersal and connectivity patterns via changes in reproductive phenology (e.g., shift in the spawning season), transport (e.g., reduced pelagic larval duration under faster development rates), mortality (e.g., changes in the exposure to lethal temperatures), and behaviour (e.g., increased larval swimming speed). Projected changes in circulation are also shown to have large effects on the simulated dispersal and connectivity patterns. Although these biophysical modelling studies are useful preliminary approaches to project the potential effects of climate change, we highlight their current limitations and discuss the way forward, in particular the need for adequate coupled hydrodynamic-biogeochemical simulations using atmospheric forcing from realistic climate change scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

abstract = {One of the pathways by which the scientific community confirms the validity of a new scientific discovery is by repeating the research that produced it. When a scientific effort fails to independently confirm the computations or results of a previous study, some fear that it may be a symptom of a lack of rigor in science, while others argue that such an observed inconsistency can be an important precursor to new discovery.\nConcerns about reproducibility and replicability have been expressed in both scientific and popular media. As these concerns came to light, Congress requested that the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine conduct a study to assess the extent of issues related to reproducibility and replicability and to offer recommendations for improving rigor and transparency in scientific research.\nReproducibility and Replicability in Science defines reproducibility and replicability and examines the factors that may lead to non-reproducibility and non-replicability in research. Unlike the typical expectation of reproducibility between two computations, expectations about replicability are more nuanced, and in some cases a lack of replicability can aid the process of scientific discovery. This report provides recommendations to researchers, academic institutions, journals, and funders on steps they can take to improve reproducibility and replicability in science.},

abstract = {THE mean of reported annual world fisheries catches for 1988-1991 (94.3 million t) was split into 39 species groups, to which fractional trophic levels, ranging from 1.0 (edible algae) to 4.2 (tunas), were assigned, based on 48 published trophic models, providing a global coverage of six major aquatic ecosystem types. The primary production required to sustain each group of species was then computed based on a mean energy transfer efficiency between trophic levels of 10%, a value that was reestimated rather than assumed. The primary production required to sustain the reported catches, plus 27 million t of discarded bycatch, amounted to 8.0% of global aquatic primary production, nearly four times the previous estimate. By ecosystem type, the requirements were only 2% for open ocean systems, but ranged from 24 to 35% in fresh water, upwelling and shelf systems, justifying current concerns for sustainability and biodiversity.},

@article{Shar2017,
abstract = {Abstract Globally, rivers deliver significant quantities of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) to the coastal ocean each year. Currently, there are no viable estimates of how much of this N and P escapes biogeochemical processing on the shelf to be exported to the open ocean; most models of N and P cycling assume that either all or none of the riverine nutrients reach the open ocean. We address this problem by using a simple mechanistic model of how a low-salinity plume behaves outside an estuary mouth. The model results in a global map of riverine water residence times on the shelf, typically a few weeks at low latitudes and up to a year at higher latitudes, which agrees well with observations. We combine the map of plume residence times on the shelf with empirical relationships that link residence time to the proportions of dissolved inorganic N (DIN) and P (DIP) exported and use a database of riverine nutrient loads to estimate the global distribution of riverine DIN and DIP supplied to the open ocean. We estimate that 75% of DIN and 80% of DIP reaches the open ocean. Ignoring processing within estuaries yields annual totals of 17?Tg DIN and 1.2?Tg DIP reaching the open ocean. For DIN this supply is about 50% of that supplied via atmospheric deposition, with significant east-west contrasts across the main ocean basins. The main sources of uncertainty are exchange rates across the shelf break and the empirical relationships between nutrient processing and plume residence time.},

@article{Vic2018,
abstract = {Deep-sea hydrothermal vents provide sources of geochemical materials that impact the global ocean heat and chemical budgets, and support complex biological communities. Vent effluents and larvae are dispersed and transported long distances by deep ocean currents, but these currents are largely undersampled and little is known about their variability. Submesoscale (0.1–10 km) currents are known to play an important role for the dispersion of biogeochemical materials in the ocean surface layer, but their impact for the dispersion in the deep ocean is unknown. Here, we use a series of nested regional oceanic numerical simulations with increasing resolution (from $\delta$x=6km to $\delta$x=0.75km) to investigate the structure and variability of highly-resolved deep currents over the Mid-Atlantic Ridge (MAR) and their role on the dispersion of the Lucky Strike hydrothermal vent effluents and larvae. We shed light on a submesoscale regime of oceanic turbulence over the MAR at 1500 m depth, contrasting with open-ocean – i.e., far from topographic features – regimes of turbulence, dominated by mesoscales. Impacts of submesoscale and tidal currents on larval dispersion and connectivity among vent populations are investigated by releasing neutrally buoyant Lagrangian particles at the Lucky Strike hydrothermal vent. Although the absolute dispersion is overall not sensitive to the model resolution, submesoscale currents are found to significantly increase both the horizontal and vertical relative dispersion of particles at O(1–10) km and O(1–10) days, resulting in an increased mixing of the cloud of particles. A fraction of particles are trapped in submesoscale coherent vortices, which enable transport over long time and distances. Tidal currents and internal tides do not significantly impact the horizontal relative dispersion. However, they roughly double the vertical dispersion. Specifically, particles undergo strong tidally-induced mixing close to rough topographic features, which allows them to rise up in the water column and to cross topographic obstacles. The mesoscale variability controls at first order the connectivity between hydrothermal sites and we do not have long enough simulations to conclude on the connectivity between the different MAR hydrothermal sites. However, our simulations suggest that the connectivity might be increased by submesoscale and tidal currents, which act to spread the cloud of particles and help them cross topographic barriers.},
