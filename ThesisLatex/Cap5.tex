This chapter serves to revisiting the larval recruitment results obtained in Chapter \ref{Chap3}, utilising the same environmental biogeochemical forcing, but this time employing the set of parameters estimated for \gls{ringens} in Chapter \ref{Chap4}. The methodology employed was identical to that described in section \ref{Chap3Meth}.\\

We will then proceed to present the results of a re-run of the \gls{ich-deb} model using an accelerated ($DEB_{abj}$) growth model.
