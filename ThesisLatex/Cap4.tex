\section{Introduction}

Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) is a biological theory which takes individuals as dynamic systems, considered as the basic level of metabolic organization, relatively easy to make energy and mass balances. This theoretical framework allows us to model the allocation of energy and nutrients in living organisms through its entire life cycle \citep{Kooi2009}, using theoretical assumptions that have remained valid during its 40 years of development \citep{Kooi2020} making it comparable to other approaches in the goal of understanding how an individual and the surrounding environment interact.\\

As water-breathing ectotherms, fish have complex life cycles that often include distinct stages such as eggs, larvae, juveniles, and adults. Fish exhibit a wide range of variation in their morphology, physiology, and behavioral adaptations, as well as the environments they inhabit \citep{Barl1961} in which a fish acquire, retain, and transfer energy to higher trophic levels of the ecosystem, the variability of the energy source during different stages of their life cycle being important \citep{Boul1981}.\\

Fish growth rates are determined by both temperature and prey availability (\ref{Chap3}), both of which play a critical role in understanding foraging dynamics and feeding behavior that influence growth physiology. Physiology-based models of fish life cycles are an exciting and rapidly emerging field; models that incorporate physiology typically focus on bioenergetics because of the inherent link to ecological performance.\\

In chapter \ref{Chap3}, we began to study the effect of temperature and food availability for the Peruvian anchoveta (\textit{\gls{ringens}}) in the ecosystem, but it is necessary to have a bioenergetic model with growth parameters properly estimated for this species, with data from this species. Furthermore, taking into account that it is well known that fish present an acceleration of growth during their early larval life stages that ends with metamorphosis, commonly called the``transition period", a feature that is not implemented in the DEB growth model parameter set used by \citep{PethRoos2013}, we will describe a growth model that includes the acceleration of metabolism during this transition period and that will help us to have a more realistic tool to understand the larval recruitment phenomenon. It is worth noting that although the estimated parameters will be useful for the entire life cycle of anchoveta, later (Chapter \ref{Chap5}) we will focus on the larval growth period and how environmental variables affect recruitment, but first, we need to understand why there are two different versions of the DEB model and what their differences are.\\

The standard version of the \acrshort{deb} model belongs to the class of ``s-models'', which assume \textbf{isomorphy} throughout the entire life cycle, providing a technical specification of the ``$std$" model. It is used to understand the difference between morphological life stages and functional life stages. Morphological life stages are assigned based on a description of the species or group, in our case, fish. A single model captures the entire life cycle from conception to death, and transitions (embryo, juvenile, adult) between functional life stages are construed as (metabolic) switches. The ``embryo'' grows, matures, but does not feed; ``juveniles'' grow, mature, feed, but are not ready to reproduce, an exclusive characteristic of ``adults''.\\

The \acrshort{deb} model with type $M-acceleration$ is like the $std-model$, but growth acceleration occurs between birth ($b$) and metamorphosis ($j$), and before and after acceleration \textbf{isomorphy} is assumed. A technical specification of the accelerated model will be ``$abj$". Metamorphosis is before puberty and occurs at maturity $E_{H}^j$, so $E_{H}^b \leq E_{H}^j \leq E_{H}^p$, which are energy thresholds, which may or may not correspond to changes in morphology. Type $M-acceleration$ has never been found in cartilaginous fish, amphibians, reptiles, birds or mammals, and typically occurs in taxa with larval stages. Since $DEB_{abj}$ is an extension of $DEB_{std}$, only two parameters ($\left \{ \dot{p}_\mathrm{Am} \right \}$ and $\dot{v}$) will be affected during the acceleration period. The transitions in $DEB_{abj}$ (embryo, juvenile, adult), are understood as in $DEB_{std}$.\\

According to the DEB theory, the initial metabolic process, referred to as ``ingestion'', involves the individual (in this case, an anchoveta) capturing food from its environment. Food is then assimilated and stored in reserves ($E$), which can be utilized for maintenance, growth, and reproduction. The second metabolic process, known as ``dissipation'', refers to the metabolic or maintenance work that does not generate new biological mass. This includes somatic maintenance, maintenance of maturity, as well as growth and reproduction costs. In the third metabolic process, known as 'body structure', a portion of the reserve is utilized to develop somatic structures. In the fourth metabolic process, ``reproduction'', a portion of the reserve is allocated for juvenile maturation and adult reproductive buffer. In adults, if there is no food assimilation because of starvation the
reproductive buffer is utilized to pay maintenance costs \citep{PethRoos2013,NisbMull2000,NisbJusu2012}.\\

The purpose of this chapter is to introduce a comprehensive life cycle model of \textit{\gls{ringens}}. The growth parameters of this model will serve to re-validate the larval recruitment results obtained by \citep{FlorLett2023}. Additionally, this model will be useful for future studies of biomass variability and population dynamics using an \gls{ibm} as well as \citep{BrocAuge2018} conducted a similar study on the west coast of Africa with another species of small pelagic fish.\\

\section{Methods}

The DEB model represents an anchoveta as an individual organism through the energy content of its three state variables: 1) the Reserve ($E$); 2) the Structure ($V$); and 3) gonads, which are affected by maturation in juveniles ($E_{H}$) and reproduction in adults ($E_{R}$).\\

The DEB model assumes that the reserve will be continuously used and refilled, while somatic
maintenance will continuously reduce and rebuild structural material throughout the individual's life. Energy is allocated to structure and maturation/reproduction only after maintenance costs have been paid, which means, DEB models prioritize the metabolic cost of individual survival through somatic maintenance over growth and reproduction \citep{Kooi2009}.\\

This study employs a non-spatial DEB model that represents time continuously using ordinary differential equations with a $\Delta t = 0.083 d \left (=2hours\right )$ time step.\\

The energy content dynamics of the reserve ($E$) will be provided by :\\

$\frac{dE}{dt} = \dot{p}_\mathrm{A} - \dot{p}_{C}$\\

where $dot{p}_\mathrm{A}$ is the rate at which anchovy assimilates energy ($Jd^-{1}$) and $\dot{p}_{C}$ is the rate that anchovy lose energy to mobilization ($Jd^-{1}$) into different processes.\\

While the dynamics of the energy content in the structure ($V$) will be given by:\\

$\frac{dV}{dt} = \frac{\kappa \dot{p}_{C} - \dot{p}_\mathrm{M}}{\left[E_{G} \right]}$\\

where $\dot{p}_{C}$ is the rate that anchovy lose energy to mobilization multiplied by fraction of mobilized reserve allocated to soma, minus $\dot{p}_\mathrm{M}$, volume-related somatic maintenance, all divided by $\left[E_{G} \right]$, the volume-specific costs of structure.\\

Table \ref{param_compar} presents a list of bioenergetic parameters for \gls{encrasicolus} and \gls{ringens}, expressed at a reference temperature of $20$ \textdegree $C$ to facilitate comparison. It is important to note that some parameters are present in one model but not in the other, and vice versa.\\

\section{Results}

The parameters of the DEB model for Peruvian anchovy were successfully used to reproduce the larval growth patterns (\ref{Chap4DEBvsData}) reported by \citep{RiouOfel2021,OfelMoya2023}, with some variability due to the use of different functional responses (f) between 0.1 and 1.\\

Starvation tests were conducted on larvae of varying sizes (0.5 and $3 cm$) to investigate the impact of food deprivation on larval recruitment in future simulations. In non-fed conditions, an increase in temperature leads to a starvation effect in fewer days. Furthermore, the \textit{\gls{encrasicolus}} is less sensitive to lack of food than the \gls{ringens}.\\

%\section{Introduction}\label{Chap4Intro}
%

%
%This theory is particularly popular in ecophysiology and population ecology, where it helps scientists understand how organisms allocate their energy and resources to various life processes, such as growth, maintenance, and reproduction. The DEB theory is based on a set of mathematical equations and concepts that describe how an organism acquires, uses, and allocates energy. These equations take into account factors like energy acquisition (feeding), energy storage, and the trade-offs between various life processes inside the individual. Different individuals (species), present differences that are captured by the DEB theory at the level of their parameter values \citep{Meer2006}. In this way, this theory helps us to understand how a species can flourish or decline, how it competes for resources or how it adapts in different environmental conditions.\\
%
%The strategy is to start from mechanistic considerations at the individual level incorporating details about the physiology of the species defining parameters that describe how the organism acquires, allocates, and uses energy \citep{KooiSabe1986}. These parameters include assimilation rates, growth rates, reproduction rates, maintenance costs, and more, all of which are typically influenced by factors like temperature, food availability, and age, cementing the basic blocks to model studies on \textit{Engraulis ringens} structured population.\\
%
%\textit{E. ringens}, commonly known as the Peruvian anchovy, is a small pelagic fish species found in the southeastern Pacific Ocean along the coasts of South America, particularly in the Humboldt Current system \citep{GutiSwar2007}. Along with the Peruvian anchovy, there is usually an important presence of sardine (\textit{Sardinops sagax}), another small pelagic species, but since the decade of the 2000s, there have been no significant landings off the peruvian coast \citep{CardFran2015}, and the fact that \textit{E. ringens} is usually associated with the coastal zone while sardines occupy more oceanic areas due to different feeding and oxygen conditions \citep{EspiBert2008,BertChai2011}, we can study the interaction of anchovy with their environment without considering a competition with sardines.\\
%
%When commercially targeted marine fish feed on phytoplankton and zooplankton, they assimilate and redistribute essential nutrients, influencing the productivity and structure of the ecosystem \citep{LeMeGuie2022}. Also, anchovies help maintain the balance and stability of marine ecosystems due their population dynamics can impact the abundance of other species, influencing ecosystem health and resilience to environmental changes \citep{FennSear2023}. Since Dynamic Energy Budget theory can be used in IBM models, ecosystem models, toxicology models \citep{LavaFilg2021}, a DEB model for \textit{E. ringens} is essential for future ecological studies and for conservation purposes.
%
%Below, we list some important concepts in DEB modelling:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%%  \centering
%  \item Energy Budget: DEB modeling starts by quantifying the energy fluxes into and out of an organism. This includes energy gained through feeding, losses due to metabolism and maintenance, growth, reproduction, and other processes.\\
%  
%  \item Allocation and Utilization: The model describes how the acquired energy is allocated and utilized for different biological processes, such as growth, reproduction, and maintenance. It helps to understand how organisms prioritize energy allocation under varying conditions.\\
%
%  \item Reserves and Structure: DEB models account for the storage of surplus energy as reserves (e.g., fat, proteins) and the development of structural components (e.g., organs, tissues). The dynamics of these reserves are critical in understanding an organism's life history.\\
%
%  \item Maintenance and Maturation: DEB models consider the energy spent on maintaining basic bodily functions (maintenance) and the energy used for growth and development (maturation) at different life stages.\\
%
%  \item Environmental Factors: The model incorporates two principal environmental factors like temperature, food availability, and other abiotic factors (not taken into account in this study) to assess their influence on energy acquisition, utilization, and allocation.\\
%
%\end{itemize}
%
%In addition, we present a list of potential uses of a DEB model:
%
%\begin{itemize}
%%  \centering
%  \item Growth and Development: DEB models provide insights into the growth patterns and development stages of organisms. They help predict how growth rates vary with environmental conditions and resource availability.\\
%  
%  \item Reproduction and Life History Strategies: DEB models enable the study of reproductive strategies, including the timing and allocation of energy to reproduction. This aids in understanding reproductive trade-offs and strategies for optimizing its survival.\\
%  
%  \item 	Responses to Environmental Change: DEB models help predict how organisms respond to changes in environmental conditions, such as temperature, nutrient availability, and pollution. This is crucial for assessing the impacts of climate change and other environmental stressors.\\
%  
%  \item Optimizing Fisheries and Aquaculture: DEB models aid in optimizing fisheries and aquaculture practices by predicting growth rates, maturation, and reproduction, leading to sustainable management of fish stocks.\\
%  
%  \item Toxicology and Ecotoxicology: Although it is not the objective of this study, DEB models can be applied to assess the effects of toxins and pollutants on an organism's energy allocation and life history traits, aiding in understanding toxicological impacts.\\
%
%\end{itemize}
%
%So, in this chapter, we will start by showing the available data collection, the calibration of a DEB model with growth acceleration during its early life stages (that was not taken into account in the Chapter \ref{Chap3}) and its implementation in the IBM called Ichthyop-DEB model, to explore the interaction of the species with its environment, focusing mainly on its food demand since the effect of temperature has been well documented previously.
%
%\section{Methods}\label{Chap4Meth}
%
%\subsection{Data collection}\label{Chap4MethDat}
%
%A model is composed of mathematical equations that represent the characteristics of a dynamic system. These equations include parameters that allow the comparison of different systems, and these parameters are estimated from empirical data \citep{RaolGiri2004}. Gather empirical data and literature data related to \textit{E. ringens}, includes growth rates, especially in their early stages of life, reproduction rates, feeding rates, body sizes, and any other relevant biological measurements.\\
%
%In spite of the application of DEB theory is challenging because the state variables and parameters are abstract quantities that are not directly observable, the parameter estimation method \citep{Lika2011a,Lika2011b} makes use of different data sources.\\
%
%However, there are different levels of difficulty in collecting individual or population data for a species. For example, a collection of population data for \textit{E. ringens} is well described by \citep{MarzShin2009}, but data on metabolic rates, feeding rates or vertical behaviour (characteristics that require captive breeding) have been studied more in other similar species and other ecosystems \citep{AldaCota2008,CermUria2003,KramZwei1968,DetwHoud1970,Hunt1971,Hunt1984,SakaKimu1976,Houd1977,MethKram1979,Thei1980,Brow1983}, while laboratory rearing (especially for early life stages) is just beginning for \textit{E. ringens} \citep{RiouOfel2021,OfelMoya2023}, difficulty in rearing, which can be explained by the high migratory behaviour of anchovies in general \citep{OlivSala2001,MoraBaba2010,TanaOhsh2010,PoliHure2015,GuraFach2017,CastNiqu2021}.\\
%
%The following is a description of the available and preferably most updated data used for DEB parameters estimation on \textit{E. ringens}.\\
%
%\subsection{Parameter estimation}
%
%Estimating parameters for a Dynamic Energy Budget (DEB) model involves a process to fit the model to empirical data, allowing it to accurately represent the energy allocation and life history of a specific organism, in this case, \textit{E. ringens}.\\
%
%We used a bivariate statistical technique \citep{Lika2011a,Lika2011b} to estimate the values of the model parameters that minimize the difference between model predictions and observed data. Then, we fitted the DEB model to the compiled empirical data, adjusting parameters to best represent the biological processes and energy dynamics of \textit{E. ringens}.\\
%
%In order to show the difference between the DEB-standard model (\textit{E. encracicolus}) used in Chapter \ref{Chap3}, a comparative table with the estimated parameters for \textit{E. ringens} is presented below.
%
%Table 1: Parameters used for the bioenergetic model describing larval growth. These values were estimated by Pethybridge et al. (2013) for Engraulis encrasicolus and compared with the parameters estimated for E. ringens (current study). The values of $T_L$, $T_H$, $T_AL$, $T_AH$ are detailed for case 1. Values for case 2 are indicated in parenthesis when different from case 1.
