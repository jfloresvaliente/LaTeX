\section{Introduction}\label{Chap2Intro}

Ichthyoplankton are the eggs and larvae of fish (early life stages), so in practical terms, these three terms may be considered equivalent, when we discuss modelling studies. Ichthyoplankton are mostly found in the epipelagic or photic zone, less than 200 $m$ deep, being part of plankton, meaning they cannot swim effectively under their own power, but must drift with the ocean currents.\\

A growing interest in the early life stages of marine organisms has emerged \citep{Stra1993,Have1995,Levi2006,GawaMoni2007,CoweSpon2009}, particularly with regard to larval transport and dispersal patterns \citep{Youn1995,GreeMayp2015,Leis2021}. This is due to the pivotal role these early life stages play in the ecology of marine organisms \citep{MoseSmit1993} and the potential value they could hold in decision-making processes for the management of \acrfull{mpa} \citep{DaloBogd2015}. A significant proportion of marine species exhibit pelagic early life stages in their life cycle \citep{Have1995}, and its locomotion is essentially driven by ocean currents and species-specific behaviors \citep{Levi1990,CowePari2006,DaloBogd2015}.\\

In the case of sessile organisms, such as scallops and corals, the concepts of larval transport, larval dispersal, and population connectivity have been formally defined. Fig. \ref{Chap2LarvalTransport}, shows \textbf{larval transport} as the horizontal translocation of a larva between points $X_{1}Y_{1}$, and $X_{2}Y_{2}$, where $X$ and $Y$ are the horizontal axes, perpendicular and parallel to the coastline respectively (to simplify, this definition ignores the vertical axis $Z$). On the other hand, \textbf{larval dispersal} refers to the spread of larvae from a spawning source to a settlement site (a geographic point from which the adult will have limited or no mobility). We note that larval transport is a component of larval dispersal. Finally, \textbf{population connectivity} is the exchange of individuals among geographically separated subpopulations \citep{PineHare2007}. We note that larval dispersal is a component of population connectivity, and therefore larval transport too. In the case of pelagic or demersal organisms such as fish, these general concepts also apply but the movement (migration) of juveniles and adults is also an important component of population connectivity \citep{NordJoha2011,CaloFeli2013,PanYe2020}.\\

During larval transport, organisms are dragged by currents and depend on environmental conditions to survive, whether temperature and/or food \citep{NocrShaw1984}, and currents may allow larvae to match their food source location \citep{CuryRoy1989}. It is in this context that larval drift models, which allow tracking the trajectory of eggs and larvae through a virtual environment, are a fundamental tool for understanding the transport patterns of different species. However, before interpret modelling results it is recommended to perform a sensitivity analysis to test the robustness of these results \citep{PeckHufn2012,SimoSieg2013}. Sensitivity analysis examines how a model's behavior is affected by changes in its parameters and it can also refer to how the response variable changes when a model parameter is modified \citep{Hamb1994,Inga2008}.\\

\end{figure}

In discussing drift models, it is possible to use the term ``released particles'', which is particularly relevant to studies in physics. Alternatively, the term ``spawned individuals'' can be employed, which is more oriented towards a biological and ecological sense. For the purposes of this research, the latter term will be employed.\\

In larval drift models, results may be sensitive to the number of spawned individuals \citep{SimoSieg2013}, to lethal temperature \citep{BrocLett2008}, to wind frequency forcing \citep{FlorTam2019}, to the spatial resolution of the forcing currents \citep{GaraKapl2014}, etc. Since number of spawned individuals has already been thoroughly studied and we have determined a robust number in previous experiments (not shown here), and lethal temperature and wind frequency have already been tested in the marine ecosystem off Peru, our focus will be on exploring whether spatial resolution significantly affects the overall patterns of larval transport and retention at the continental shelf scale.\\

\section{Methods}\label{Chap2Meth}

An \acrfull{ibm} simulates populations and communities by following individuals and their properties \citep{DeanGrim2014}. As a base, this \acrshort{ibm}, that we will use from here on, is a lagrangian tool called \href{https://ichthyop.org/}{Ichthyop} – Lagrangian tool for simulating ichthyoplankton dynamics \citep{LettVerl2008}, version 3.2.\\

\subsection{Larval drift model: Ichthyop}

\gls{ich} is a Java-based open-source software and its source code is available on \href{https://github.com/ichthyop/ichthyop}{Github}. This tool is designed to study the effects of physical and biological factors on ichthyoplankton dynamics by simulating the movement of individuals based on stored data provided by a hydrodynamic model (ROMS/CROCO, MARS, or NEMO). The data (stored in $netCDF$ format with the extension $.nc$), which includes currents, temperature and salinity, varies in time and space and is imposed on the individuals. \gls{ich} also includes the most significant processes involved in the early life of fish, such as spawning, growth, mortality and recruitment, and modifying the source code allows for the addition of new features and processes.\\

\gls{ich} has a wide range of applications. The software can be used to study the transport processes of eggs and larvae of marine species and their effect on recruitment variability, to simulate egg flotation and larval growth based on temperature and salinity, and to simulate vertical migration behavior and horizontal or vertical dispersion. Additionally, it allows for tracking the trajectory of individuals and visualizing the results with \href{https://earth.google.com/web/}{Google Earth} or on any other data visualization software, such as \href{https://www.r-project.org/}{R} or \href{https://mathworks.com/products/matlab.html}{Matlab}.\\

This tool operates through a user-friendly graphical interface (Fig. \ref{Chap2IchthyopGUI}) that guides the user through the set-up process. The user can represent the results in gif animations by coloring the variable of interest, such as size, stage, age, depth, or temperature of surrounding water. The program can also be run on the command line, making it ideal for serial simulations. In both cases, the results are saved in $netCDF$ format, which can be read by various data processing programs.\\

Two spatial distribution schemes can be used to simulate spawning: a random spawning in a selected area or user-predetermined positions and depths. The individual-based model is run at each time step after initialization. Environmental variables are updated during simulation at a frequency equal to the saved data. Between these time steps, they are interpolated. At each time step, each individual moves, grows, and is tested for mortality and recruitment.\\

In general, a protocol designed for this type of \acrshort{ibm} approach will be followed \citep{GrimBerg2006,GrimBerg2010}. In the following chapters, the model will be extended to explore the dynamics of fish early life stages.\\

\subsection{Purpose}\label{Chap2MethPurp}

To evaluate the impact of spatial resolution, bathymetry source and coastline behavior on transport and retention patterns in the coastal zone off Peru.\\

\subsection{Entities and state variables}\label{Chap2MethEnti}

The model included two types of entities: the environment and the individuals (virtual particles). The environment was represented by stored hydrodynamic simulations from the \acrlong{croco} (\href{https://www.croco-ocean.org/}{CROCO}, \cite{HiltAucl2020,ShchMcwi2005}) providing the forcing state variables: ocean current velocities ($ms^{-1}$), over the \acrshort{nhcs}. Individuals were characterized by the following state variables: age ($d$) and location in 3D (longitude, latitude and depth).\\

Fig. \ref{Chap2SpawningZone} shows the three different \acrshort{croco} configurations with contrasted grid size and bathymetry were used, in order to evaluate the model sensitivity to hydrodynamic resolution (Table \ref{Chap2TabSimus}). The first configuration ($D01$) extends from $22$\textdegree $S$ to $5$\textdegree $N$ in latitude and from $96$\textdegree $W$ to $70$\textdegree $W$ in longitude, with a horizontal resolution of $\sim$ 10 $km$ and $32$ vertical levels. The bathymetry comes from the STRM30 dataset \citep{BeckSand2009}, then it was interpolated on the model grid and smoothed in order to reduce errors in the horizontal pressure gradient. The second configuration ($D02$) extends from $20$\textdegree $S$ to $5$\textdegree $S$ with a horizontal resolution of $\sim$ 2 $km$ and $42$ vertical levels. The $D02$ domain is embedded in the $D01$ domain, through an offline nesting procedure (``roms2roms''; \cite{MasoMole2010}). We used two different bathymetries for the $D02$ domain: one interpolated from the $D01$ bathymetry (i.e., similar to the $D01$ bathymetry) and one interpolated directly from the STRM30 dataset. Note that consequently the former is smoother than the latter, so in the following we call them $D02s$ and $D02r$, respectively.\\

The three configurations were used to obtain quasi-equilibrium solutions, forced by monthly climatologies (over the period 2008-2015) at their surface and lateral boundaries. They all used the same atmospheric forcing fields. The wind stress was computed from a monthly climatology of the \acrlong{ascat} (\href{https://www.ospo.noaa.gov/Products/atmosphere/ascat/}{ASCAT}, 1/4\textdegree gridded product). Other atmospheric fluxes (shortwave heat fluxes and freshwater fluxes) come from the \acrlong{coads} (\href{https://repository.library.noaa.gov/view/noaa/49337}{COADS}) monthly climatology \citep{DasiYoun1994}. Model \acrfull{sst} was restored to observed climatological monthly \acrshort{sst} derived from the merged multi-sensor OSTIA product \citep{DonlMart2012} following the methodology of \citep{BarnSief1995}. Open boundary conditions for the $D01$ domain were derived from a monthly climatology of the \href{https://www.mercator-ocean.eu/en/ocean-science/glorys/}{GLORYS2V4} reanalysis [1/4\textdegree horizontal resolution; \citep{FerrPare2012}] for temperature, salinity, zonal and meridional current velocity components and sea-level height. Climatological simulations were run for 10 years, the first 4 years being considered as a spin-up. In the present study, the last three years were used to force \gls{ich} (Fig. \ref{Chap2Ichthyop}).\\

\subsection{Process overview and scheduling}\label{Chap2MethProc}

Virtual individuals were spawned in the physical environment according to a determined spatial (area, depth and bathymetry) and temporal (month and frequency) releasing strategy that constituted the initial conditions (section \ref{Chap2MethInit}). For each time step (2 hours), every egg or larva was transported by the 3D current fields. Finally, they were tested for recruitment on the continental shelf.\\

\subsection{Design concepts}\label{Chap2MethDesi}

\begin{itemize}

\item Stochasticity: Individuals were initially randomly distributed over the Peruvian continental shelf. We chose the number of individuals spawned ($5000$) such that the variability of simulated recruitment between three replicates of the same simulation was negligible.\\

\item Coastline behavior: One of the utilities of \gls{ich} is the option to use different response configurations of a particle when faced with the decision of what to do when it touches the land boundary (coastline). We tested three types of coastline behaviors: 1) \textbf{BEACHING}: \gls{ich} does move the particle inland but ``kill'' it. From now onward the particle is out of the simulation. 2) \textbf{BOUNCING}: the coastline acts as a billard edge and the particle will bounce as a billard ball in the events that the move would take it beyond the coastline. The particle bounces back as much as it would penetrate inland and 3) \textbf{STANDSTILL}: the particle gives up on the move that would take it inland and just wait until next time step for trying another move.\\

\item Observation: After 30 $days$ of drift, each particle was tested to see if it was within the continental shelf and was considered ``retained'' or ``non-retained''. From now on, we will call \gls{cri1}, referring ``retention'' as a criterion for larval recruitment.\\

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Initialization}\label{Chap2MethInit}

In each simulation, individuals were spawned randomly along the coastal spawning area each month at days 1, 10 and 20, during the three climatological years used.\\

Spawning area (Fig. \ref{Chap2SpawningZone}) was defined between latitudes 6\textdegree $S$ and 14\textdegree $S$, depths 0 $m$ to 45 $m$ and from the coast to bathymetry contour 2000 $m$. This area was further splitted into different subdomains for the simulations post-processing and analysis (spawning depth ranges 0 - 15 $m$, 15 - 30 $m$ and 30 - 45 $m$; cross-shore extension delimited by isobaths 0 - 100 $m$, 100 - 500 $m$, 500 - 2000 $m$).\\

\subsection{Sub-models}\label{Chap2MethSubMod}

\begin{itemize}

\item Transport: To simulate particle transport, virtual individuals were advected using a trilinear interpolation scheme of the velocity fields derived from \acrshort{croco}, in time and space, and using a forward Euler numerical scheme with horizontal diffusion following \cite{PeliMarc2007}.\\

\item Retention: We considered one age-criterion for recruitment, hereafter referred to as \gls{cri1}. An individual was considered as ``recruited'' if it was within the coastal zone (offshore limit: the 2000 $m$ isobath) at age 30 $days$.\\

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Simulations and sensitivity analysis}\label{Chap2MethSimSens}

From this chapter onwards, each drift simulation will be listed under the name ``\textbf{$sim \#$}'', for example, in the text, saying ``$sim 1$'', will be equivalent to saying ``\textit{simulation 1}''. Details of each simulation will be detailed in a table in its corresponding chapter.\\

Three simulations were performed in order to explore the model sensitivity to different environmental forcing fields (Table \ref{Chap2TabSimus}). In order to fit the spatial extent of the 2 $km$ grid, spawned individuals was constrained in the coastal area between 6\textdegree $S$ and 14\textdegree $S$ (Fig. \ref{Chap2SpawningZone}, dotted box) for all three simulations. Larval recruitment was calculated at 30 $days$ (\gls{cri1}).\\

\section{Results}\label{Chap2Resu}

Simulated retention patterns obtained with the three tested configurations of the hydrodynamic model were very similar and did not show any significant differences on retention patterns related to the use of different spatial resolutions ($Sim 1$, $Sim 2$ and $Sim 3$, Fig. \ref{Chap2Recruitment3bars}). The main differences concerned the $D02s$ configuration ($Sim 2$) that exhibits slightly higher retention values for austral summer months (Fig. \ref{Chap2Recruitment3bars}a) and for the coastal spawning zone (0 - 100 $m$ isobath, Fig. \ref{Chap2Recruitment3bars}d). The latitudinal range between 10\textdegree - 12\textdegree $S$ was the most favorable for larval retention (Fig. \ref{Chap2Recruitment3bars}b) and a direct relationship was observed between spawning depth and larval retention, being lower near the surface and higher in deeper layers (Fig. \ref{Chap2Recruitment3bars}c).\\

An ANOVA (Table \ref{Chap2TabAnovaSimus}) was applied to evaluate which of the factors (spawning year, spawning month, spawning depth, spawning bathymetry, spawning latitude, horizontal resolution and coastline behavior) and its interactions had the greatest impact. Spawning  depth explained 28.32 \% of the variance and showed a direct relationship between spawning depth and retention rate, with higher values when the particles were spawned deeper (30 - 45 $m$) and lower values when they were spawned near the surface (0 - 15 $m$, 15 - 30 $m$) (Fig. \ref{Chap2Recruitment3bars}c). Spawning bathymetry explained 12.27 \% of the variance, with the highest retention rates in the area closest to the coast (0 - 100 $m$) than those spawned offshore (100 - 500 $m$, 500 - 2000 $m$) (Fig. \ref{Chap2Recruitment3bars}d). Spawning month explained only 4.95 \% of the variance and showed seasonal variability with the summer months having the highest retention rate (Fig. \ref{Chap2Recruitment3bars}a). Spawning latitude explained 4.47 \% of the variance and the zone between 10 - 12\textdegree $S$ was the major latitudinal retention zone (Fig. \ref{Chap2Recruitment3bars}b). Finally, with an almost negligible percentage of variance explanation, are spatial resolution (0.1 \%), coastline behavior (0.04 \%) and spawning year (0.01 \%).\\

Spawning depth had the most significant effect in all three simulations. It interacted with the spawning month and explained 10.15 \% of the variance of larval retention, affecting the seasonal pattern (Fig. \ref{Chap2Recruitment3sim3depth}). Particles spawned near the surface (0 - 15 $m$, Fig. \ref{Chap2Recruitment3sim3depth} a, d, g) showed a seasonal pattern favoring retention in the winter months, while this pattern reverses as spawning depth increases (15 - 30 $m$, Fig. \ref{Chap2Recruitment3sim3depth} b, e, h; 30 - 45 $m$, c, f, i).\\

Fig. \ref{Chap2SpatialVariation} showed that retention rates between 10 - 12 \textdegree $S$ remained constant throughout the year in the 3 simulations, and interacting with spawning month, explained 8.5 \% of the variance in retention. The northern zone between 6\textdegree $S$ - 10\textdegree $S$ showed seasonal variability with higher retention values in summer and accented values in January and February in $sim 2$ ($D02s$).\\

A sensitivity analysis to spatial resolution and coastline behavior was applied to the retention rates off Peru using \gls{ich} model, a powerfull Lagrangian tool \citep{LettVerl2008}. This tool allowed us to track virtual particles in a 3D environment and to know the location of each particle at each time step.\\

The fact that there was no significant difference between $sim 1$ ($D01$), $sim 2$ ($D02s$) and $sim 3$ ($D02r$) strengthen the conclusions found by \citep{BrocLett2008} who used a spatial resolution forcing only slightly greater than 10 $km$, despite their study had a wider latitudinal range (2\textdegree - 20\textdegree $S$) than the one used in this chapter (6\textdegree - 14\textdegree $S$). \cite{BrocLett2008} also found that spawning depth is the most important factor (22.7 \% of explained variance) although in a smaller proportion than in the present chapter (28.32 \%). However, \cite{BrocLett2008} found that the next most important factors were spawning latitude (7.2 \%) and then spawning bathymetry (3.9 \%), in contrast to the present chapter in which spawning latitude (4.47 \%) was less important than spawning bathymetry (12.27 \%). Concerning the spawning bathymetry, finding a higher value of percentage of variance explanation in this chapter compared to \cite{BrocLett2008}, could be due to the topographic sources \citep{SmitSand1997} used by them and the one used in the present chapter \citep{BeckSand2009} to represent the bathymetry, which could provide a better description of the seafloor and affect circulation and retention structures also affecting retention rates as \cite{RojaLand2014} reported. The remaining interactions among factors have a negligible effect, explaining less than 1 \% of the variance in larval retention.\\

\section{Discussion}\label{Chap2Disc}

\cite{LettPenv2007} applied Lagrangian simulation experiments to evaluate the processes of enrichment, retention and concentration proposed as the mechanisms that favor the recruitment of marine species \citep{Baku1998, Baku2010}. \cite{LettPenv2007} showed that after 20 $days$ of drifting, the zones of highest retention were located between grade 10\textdegree $S$ - 14\textdegree $S$, similar to our results in the 3 simulations, values that were constant throughout the year in this latitudinal range, even though retention was calculated after 30 $days$ of drift. \cite{LettPenv2007} also showed a general seasonal pattern with the summer months favoring retention as well as in this chapter, however, we can now know that retention is highly dependent on initial depth (spawning depth), in agreement with \cite{BrocLett2008}, therefore, the larval retention of any species will depend on its spawning depth or its vertical behavior \citep{OspiPara2012}. A spatial resolution analysis was applied in the Humboldt ecosystem for one mollusk species \citep{GaraKapl2014}. Between 3 $km$ and 7.5 $km$ hydrodynamic forcings, no difference in dispersion distance was observed, however, both experiments also demonstrated that the closer to coast, the greater the success of the individuals, in this case called larval settlement (and retention in this chapter). It should be noted that they used much longer drift times (80 $days$ and 140 $days$).\\

The work did not evaluate the effect of wind forcing frequency (monthly winds and daily winds) at high resolution (2 $km$, $D02$) on retention rates while maintaining patterns, although this was applied only in very coastal and small areas at the scale of a bay \citep{FlorTam2019}.\\

This could have implications when we use different coastline behaviors, as demonstrated in this chapter, in which only beaching behavior in areas very close to the coast (0 - 100 $m$) had significant impacts on retention rates, although did not have a major impact at level of the continental shelf off Peru, could have a significant effect if we study problems such as oil spills or accumulation of microplastics on the coast \citep{AtwoFalc2019,LopeNajj2021}.\\

Finally, we conclude that to work on \textit{\gls{ringens}} recruitment simulations, in order to save computational time and energy, we can continue with a spatial resolution of 10 $km$. In addition, it is recommended to use the coastal behavior called standstill, since for the purposes of our research it will not significantly affect near-shore particle transport.\\
